This project will cover different experiments for relation extraction.

Experiment 1:
	Simple CNN - 3 conv 3 pool layers fully connected network in the end
	Glove vectors
	NYT Corpus

Experiment 2:
    Capsule Network Implementation [capsnet.py].

Experiment 3:
    Better, faster and lighter Capsule Network [ capsNetv2.py]

Experiment 4:
    Adding 1*1 convolutions in Experiment 1

Experiment 5:
    Hierarchial networks with Attention for Relation Extraction with zero state
    for each sentence
    Exploring seq2seq models with attention

============================

Experiment 6:
    Increasing layers in Capsule network. Find new way to calc loss. Remove NAN and INF.

Experiment 7:
    Memory networks

Experiment 8:
    GAN for Relation Extraction

Experiment 9:
    RL for Relation Extraction

Other Experiments:
    Combining 2 graphs and keeping only 1 trainable
