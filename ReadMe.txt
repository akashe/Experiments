This project will cover different experiments for relation extraction.

Experiment 1:
	Simple CNN - 3 conv 3 pool layers fully connected network in the end
	Glove vectors
	NYT Corpus

Experiment 2:
    Capsule Network Implementation [capsnet.py].

Experiment 3:
    Better, faster and lighter Capsule Network [ capsNetv2.py]

Future Works:

Experiment 4:
    Multi-gpu architecture for experiments

Experiment 5:
    Hierarchial networks with Attention for Relation Extraction

Experiment 6:
    GAN for Relation Extraction

Experiment 7:
    RL for Relation Extraction
